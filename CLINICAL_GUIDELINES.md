## Obtaining Informed Consent

### Consent Conversation Script

**Introduction:**
> "I'd like to tell you about a tool I sometimes use in sessions called TherapyLens. It's completely optional, and I want to explain what it does so you can decide if you're comfortable with it."

**Explain the Technology:**
> "TherapyLens uses your webcam to track behavioral patterns like eye movement and breathing. It acts like a second pair of eyes to help me notice things I might miss while we're talking. It does NOT record video or audio—it only measures patterns."

**Explain the Benefits:**
> "This can help me notice when you might be feeling anxious, stressed, or uncomfortable, even if you don't mention it. It's especially helpful because I can focus more on listening to you rather than trying to watch everything at once."

**Explain Privacy:**
> "All the information stays on this computer during our session. There's no recording, and everything is deleted when we finish. You'll see a clear indicator when tracking is on. You can ask me to pause or stop it anytime, for any reason."

**Obtain Consent:**
> "Would you be comfortable trying this today? You can always change your mind during our session."

### Document Consent

Record in patient notes:
```
Date: [Date]
TherapyLens Consent: [Obtained/Declined]
Patient questions addressed: [Yes/No]
Patient understanding confirmed: [Yes/No]
Notes: [Any specific concerns or conditions]
```

### Special Populations

**Trauma Survivors:**
- Extra emphasis on control and autonomy
- Explain pause feature clearly
- Respect triggers around surveillance
- Go slowly with introduction

**Neurodivergent Patients:**
- Explain how baseline differences are handled
- Emphasize non-judgmental nature
- May need visual aids for explanation
- Written information helpful

**Paranoid Patients:**
- May decline—respect this boundary
- Offer to demonstrate system first
- Show privacy features clearly
- Never pressure to consent

## Interpreting Behavioral Metrics

### Eye Contact

**What It Measures:**
Percentage of time patient's gaze is directed toward therapist/camera area.

**Normal Range:**
- Neurotypical adults: 40-70%
- Significant variation based on culture, personality, neurodiversity

**Clinical Interpretations:**

| Metric | Possible Meaning | Consider |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Sudden decrease (>20%) | Discomfort, shame, lying, emotional pain | Topic causing distress |
| Prolonged avoidance (>2 min) | Severe discomfort, dissociation, cultural norm | Slow down, check in |
| Increased eye contact | Engagement, trust building, seeking connection | Positive sign |
| Baseline low (<30%) | Autism, social anxiety, cultural norm | Check patient baseline |

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Assuming low eye contact = lying
- ❌ Ignoring cultural differences
- ❌ Not accounting for autism/ADHD
- ❌ Using as sole indicator

**Best Practice:**
✅ Compare to patient's own baseline  
✅ Consider context of discussion  
✅ Look for changes, not absolutes  
✅ Combine with other clinical observations

### Breathing Rate

**What It Measures:**
Breaths per minute based on chest/shoulder movement.

**Normal Range:**
- Adults at rest: 12-20 bpm
- Individual variation exists

**Clinical Interpretations:**

| Metric | Possible Meaning | Clinical Action |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 25+ bpm | Hyperventilation, panic attack | Grounding exercises immediately |
| 19-24 bpm | Elevated anxiety, stress response | Acknowledge, explore trigger |
| Sudden increase (50%+) | Triggered by current topic | Note topic, consider slowing |
| Very shallow breathing | Dissociation, freeze response | Gentle grounding, check presence |
| Deep, slow breathing | Attempting self-regulation | Acknowledge coping attempt |

**Breathing and Trauma:**
- Shallow breathing = freeze response
- Rapid breathing = fight/flight
- Held breath = bracing for impact
- Erratic breathing = dysregulation

**Intervention Examples:**

```
Hyperventilation Detected (26 bpm):
"I notice your breathing has quickened. Let's take a moment. 
Can you take a slow breath with me? In for 4, hold for 4, out for 4."

Topic-Related Increase:
"I notice something shifted when we started talking about [topic]. 
How are you feeling right now?"

Shallow Breathing (Dissociation):
"[Patient name], can you feel your feet on the floor? 
Tell me 5 things you can see in this room."
```

### Gaze Stability

**What It Measures:**
How steady vs. rapid/scattered eye movements are.

**Clinical Interpretations:**

| Metric | Possible Meaning | Consider |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Very low (<30%) | High anxiety, racing thoughts, ADHD | May need focus support |
| Very high (>95%) | Dissociation, "thousand-yard stare" | Ground patient |
| Fluctuating | Normal engagement and processing | Healthy pattern |
| Sudden drops | Increased anxiety, overwhelm | Check pacing |

**Important Notes:**
- ADHD patients naturally have lower stability
- Some thinking styles involve more eye movement
- Cultural differences in gaze patterns exist

## Using AI Insights

### What Claude Provides

Claude analyzes patterns and offers:
1. **Observations** about physiological changes
2. **Possible interpretations** of patterns
3. **Gentle suggestions** for therapeutic exploration
4. **Pattern recognition** across session

### What Claude Does NOT Do

- ❌ Make diagnoses
- ❌ Suggest specific medications
- ❌ Replace clinical judgment
- ❌ Have access to patient history
- ❌ Know the full context

### How to Use AI Insights

**During Session (Whisper Mode):**

1. **Glance, Don't Stare**
   - Brief check every few minutes
   - Don't let it distract from patient
   - Remain present and engaged

2. **Validate, Don't Accept Blindly**
   - Does this match your impression?
   - Does it fit the clinical context?
   - Could there be other explanations?

3. **Use as Hypothesis Generator**
   - "I wonder if..."
   - "Could it be that..."
   - "Let me check in..."

**Example Integration:**

```
Claude Insight: "Patient's breathing became shallow when 
discussing work stress. Consider exploring this topic further."

Poor Response:
"The computer says you're stressed about work."

Good Response:
"I'm curious—when you talked about work just now, I noticed 
something shift. How are you feeling about that situation?"
```

**After Session (Report Review):**

1. **Look for Patterns**
   - What topics triggered responses?
   - What helped patient regulate?
   - Any unexpected reactions?

2. **Inform Treatment Planning**
   - Topics needing more time
   - Effective coping strategies
   - Timing and pacing needs

3. **Track Progress**
   - Compare across sessions (if appropriate)
   - Notice improved regulation
   - Identify persistent triggers

### When to Ignore AI Insights

Ignore suggestions if:
- Contradicts your clinical judgment
- Doesn't fit patient's presentation
- Would harm therapeutic alliance
- Patient context suggests otherwise
- Insight seems technically implausible

**Remember:** You are the expert. AI is the assistant.

## Neurodiversity Considerations

### Autism Spectrum

**Baseline Differences:**
- Often lower eye contact (30-40% may be typical)
- May prefer looking away when thinking
- Direct eye contact can be painful/overwhelming
- Different ≠ dishonest or disengaged

**System Adjustments:**
```
Patient Baseline Settings:
Typical Eye Contact: 30-40% (vs. 45-55% neurotypical)
Stress Threshold: Adjust based on individual
Alert Thresholds: Set higher tolerance for variation
```

**Clinical Approach:**
- Set baseline during intake session
- Explain you understand their comfort level
- Don't pressure for more eye contact
- Focus on other engagement indicators

**Red Flags Specific to Autism:**
- Sudden increase in eye contact (possible masking/distress)
- Stimming increases during specific topics
- Shutdown/meltdown indicators

### ADHD

**Baseline Differences:**
- More variable gaze (lower stability is normal)
- More fidgeting and movement
- Attention varies with topic interest
- Hyperfocus vs. difficulty focusing

**System Adjustments:**
```
Patient Baseline Settings:
Gaze Stability: 40-60% (vs. 70-85% neurotypical)
Expect more variation minute-to-minute
Alert Thresholds: Higher tolerance for fluctuation
```

**Clinical Approach:**
- Topic transitions may show clearer patterns
- Interest = increased stability
- Boredom = increased movement/instability
- Use insights to pace session

**Helpful Indicators:**
- When do they focus best?
- What topics hold attention?
- When does dysregulation occur?

### Complex PTSD / Dissociative Disorders

**What to Watch:**
- Sudden "freeze" (stable gaze, shallow breathing)
- Windows of tolerance (regulation sweet spot)
- Dissociative episodes (fixed stare, non-responsive)
- Grounding effectiveness

**Crisis Indicators:**
```
CRITICAL PATTERN - Possible Dissociation:
- Fixed gaze >90 seconds
- Breathing very shallow (<8 bpm)
- No response to name
- Glazed appearance

ACTION: Immediate gentle grounding
```

**Grounding Protocol:**
1. Say patient's name gently
2. Orient to present ("You're here with me, in my office")
3. Sensory grounding (feet on floor, hands on chair)
4. 5-4-3-2-1 technique
5. Don't touch without permission

**Track What Works:**
- Which grounding techniques are effective?
- How long does regulation take?
- What triggers dissociation?
- Early warning signs

---

## Crisis Response

### Panic Attack Protocol

**Indicators:**
- Breathing >25 bpm
- Extreme agitation
- Patient reports feeling unable to breathe
- Visible distress

**Response:**
1. **Stay Calm**
   - Model regulation
   - Speak slowly and clearly
   - Maintain therapeutic presence

2. **Immediate Intervention**
   ```
   "You're having a panic attack. You're safe. This will pass.
   Let's breathe together. Can you breathe with me?
   In... 2... 3... 4... Hold... 2... 3... 4... Out... 2... 3... 4..."
   ```

3. **Pause TherapyLens**
   - Focus entirely on patient
   - Remove any sense of being watched
   - Minimize all distractions

4. **Grounding Techniques**
   - 5-4-3-2-1 sensory
   - Feet on floor
   - Cold water/ice
   - Bilateral stimulation (tapping)

5. **Document**
   - What triggered it
   - How long it lasted
   - What helped
   - Patient response

### Dissociative Episode

**Indicators:**
- Fixed stare >90 seconds
- Non-responsive to name
- Glazed or blank expression
- Shallow or minimal breathing
- "Not there" quality

**Response:**
1. **Gentle Reorientation**
   ```
   "[Name], can you hear me? You're here in my office.
   You're safe. Can you feel your feet on the ground?
   Can you tell me where you are?"
   ```

2. **Avoid:**
   - ❌ Touching (can be triggering)
   - ❌ Loud noises
   - ❌ Rapid movement
   - ❌ Confrontation

3. **Gradual Reintegration**
   - Orient to time/place/person
   - Sensory grounding
   - Check understanding
   - Process if appropriate

4. **Post-Episode Processing**
   - What do they remember?
   - What triggered it?
   - How can we prevent it?
   - Update safety plan

### Suicidal Ideation

**If Patient Discloses Suicidal Thoughts:**

1. **Pause TherapyLens Immediately**
   - Full attention to patient
   - No distractions

2. **Conduct Risk Assessment**
   - Intent, plan, means, timeline
   - Protective factors
   - Previous attempts
   - Current supports

3. **Follow Your Clinical Protocol**
   - Safety planning
   - Referral if needed
   - Emergency services if imminent risk
   - Document thoroughly

4. **Do NOT Rely on TherapyLens**
   - Behavioral metrics are NOT suicide predictors
   - Clinical judgment is essential
   - Direct conversation is required
   - Standard protocols always apply

## Best Practices

### Session Preparation

**Before Patient Arrives:**
1. Test system functionality
2. Ensure camera is working
3. Review previous session notes
4. Check patient baseline settings
5. Prepare workspace (minimal distraction)

**First Session with System:**
1. Extra time for consent discussion
2. Demonstrate system if requested
3. Let patient see the interface
4. Establish baseline metrics
5. Process patient's experience after

### During Session

**Optimal Use:**
- Glance at metrics, don't stare
- Let insights inform, not dictate
- Stay present with patient
- Notice your own reactions to data
- Pause if system becomes distracting

**Balance:**
```
70% - Patient (eye contact, active listening)
20% - Internal (clinical thinking, processing)
10% - System (brief metric checks)
```

**When to Pause:**
- Patient requests it
- System is distracting you
- During emotional crisis
- When building rapport
- Patient seems uncomfortable
- Technical issues occur

### After Session

**Immediate (5 minutes):**
1. Review session report
2. Note key patterns
3. Consider treatment adjustments
4. Export report if needed
5. Delete all data

**Session Notes:**
Include:
- Notable behavioral patterns
- Triggers identified
- Effective interventions
- Patient response to system
- Baseline adjustments needed

**Do NOT Include:**
- Raw metric dumps
- Uninterpreted numbers
- Unsupported conclusions
- Deterministic interpretations

### Cross-Session Comparison

**When Appropriate:**
- Tracking treatment progress
- Identifying persistent triggers
- Evaluating intervention effectiveness
- Supporting clinical hypotheses

**When NOT Appropriate:**
- Using past metrics to dismiss current concerns
- Comparing different patients
- Making rigid predictions
- Replacing current observation

**Method:**
```
Compare:
- Regulation patterns (improving over time?)
- Trigger consistency (same topics, same reactions?)
- Coping effectiveness (grounding working better?)
- Baseline changes (overall anxiety decreasing?)
```

### Supervision and Consultation

**Regular Topics:**
- How system affects therapeutic alliance
- Accuracy of interpretations
- Ethical concerns or dilemmas
- Cultural competency issues
- Challenging cases

**Case Consultation:**
When presenting cases:
- Include behavioral patterns as context
- Don't over-rely on metrics
- Describe full clinical picture
- Seek feedback on interpretation

---

## Cultural Competency

### Eye Contact Variations

Different cultures have different norms:

| Culture | Eye Contact Norm |
|---------|-----------------|
| Western (US/Europe) | Direct eye contact = respect, honesty |
| East Asian | Less direct = respect, modesty |
| Middle Eastern | Varies by gender and relationship |
| Indigenous American | Often less direct, especially with elders |
| African (varies) | Complex rules based on hierarchy |

**Clinical Approach:**
- Ask about cultural norms
- Adjust baselines accordingly
- Don't pathologize cultural differences
- Educate yourself about patient's culture

### Gender Considerations

- Women may have different baseline behaviors
- Some cultures have gender-specific eye contact rules
- Be aware of power dynamics
- Adjust interpretations accordingly

### Trauma-Informed Care

Many behavioral patterns can result from trauma:
- Hypervigilance (high anxiety metrics)
- Avoidance (low eye contact)
- Freeze response (dissociation indicators)
- Distrust (variable engagement)

**Approach:**
- Assume trauma history possible
- Go slowly with any monitoring
- Emphasize patient control
- Process system use in therapy

---

## Common Questions

### "Can this detect lying?"

**No.** While people may exhibit certain behaviors when being deceptive, these same behaviors occur with anxiety, discomfort, thinking hard, trauma responses, and many other states. Using TherapyLens as a lie detector is:
- Unethical
- Unreliable
- Harmful to therapeutic alliance
- Potentially discriminatory

### "Should I use it in every session?"

**No.** Consider:
- Some patients may find it intrusive
- Some sessions don't benefit from it
- Too much data can be overwhelming
- Therapeutic alliance comes first
- Use selectively, not routinely

### "What if the patient asks to see the data?"

**Show them!** Transparency builds trust:
- Walk through the metrics together
- Explain what they mean
- Discuss patterns you noticed
- Answer questions openly
- Use as psychoeducation opportunity

### "Can I use this for research?"

**Maybe.** Requirements:
- IRB approval mandatory
- Separate research consent
- Clear research protocols
- Proper data handling
- Published methodology
- Peer review

### "What about telehealth?"

**Limited applicability:**
- Webcam quality varies
- Internet latency issues
- Patient's home environment
- Privacy concerns (who else is there?)
- Technical literacy needed
- Consider carefully

---

## Troubleshooting

### Patient Seems Uncomfortable

**Signs:**
- More anxious than usual
- Keeps looking at camera
- Asks repeatedly about recording
- Less engaged than typically
- Requests system be turned off

**Response:**
1. Acknowledge their comfort matters most
2. Offer to pause or stop
3. Process their experience
4. Don't pressure to continue
5. Note this in session documentation

### Metrics Don't Match Clinical Impression

**Possible Reasons:**
- System error or limitation
- Misinterpretation of metrics
- Patient masking well
- Medication effects
- Individual differences

**Response:**
- Trust your clinical judgment first
- Investigate discrepancies
- Discuss openly in supervision
- Adjust baseline settings
- Consider discontinuing use

### Technical Issues

**During Session:**
1. Don't let technical problems derail therapy
2. Pause or stop system
3. Focus on clinical work
4. Troubleshoot after session

**Persistent Problems:**
- Report to IT/support
- Use backup plans
- Don't depend solely on system
- Have non-tech alternatives ready

## Final Reminders

1. **You are the expert.** TherapyLens supports your expertise; it doesn't replace it.

2. **Patient first, always.** If the system interferes with therapeutic alliance, don't use it.

3. **Cultural humility.** Behavioral norms vary widely. What's "normal" for one person may not be for another.

4. **Trauma-informed.** Many patients have trauma histories. Monitoring can feel triggering.

5. **Privacy matters.** Protect patient data as rigorously as any other clinical information.

6. **Continuous learning.** Technology and clinical practice both evolve. Stay current.

7. **Ethical practice.** When in doubt, consult colleagues, supervisors, or ethics boards.

8. **Therapeutic alliance.** This is and always will be the most important factor in successful therapy.
